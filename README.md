# docker-node-red-armhf
An Alpine Linux container to run Node-RED on ARM devices

## About

This container provides a (much easier and faster) way to get [Node-RED][nr] up and running on `armhf` devices like the Raspberry Pi 2/3 and ODROID development boards, using Alpine Linux and NodeJS 6.x

It contains a number of modules for interacting with cloud services but (for now, at least) relatively little to do with hardware - this has to do with the difficulty to get a lot of the hardware-oriented modules to build properly.
